# Singleton Design Pattern

As you remember when we started this repo we said we should be able to explain each algorithm in a single breath

The singleton design pattern is like having only one toy car of your favorite color. You can play with it anytime you want, and you always know it's the same toy car because there's only one of it.

In computer programming, the singleton design pattern is used to make sure there's only one instance of a particular object in the program. This can be useful when you want to make sure that multiple parts of the program are using the same object, and you don't want to accidentally create duplicates.

Just like how you might label your toy car with your name so that you know it's yours, the singleton object is labeled in such a way that the program knows it's the only one of its kind.

###  Real time scenario ü§ôüèæ
Let's say you have some settings in your app that holds various user settings for your application, such as the user's name, email address, and preferred language. You want to make sure that all parts of your application are using the same set of user settings, and that no part of the application accidentally creates a duplicate set of settings.

To ensure this, you can use the Singleton design pattern to make sure there's only one instance of the Settings class in your application.

### Definition & Pros/Cons

_The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern involves creating a class with a private constructor to prevent other classes from creating instances of it, and a public static method that allows other classes to access the single instance. The Singleton pattern is useful in situations where it's important to ensure that there's only one instance of a class in the system, such as in a logging system, database connection pool, or configuration manager._

### Pros of Singleton design pattern:

* Ensures a single instance: The Singleton pattern guarantees that there is only one instance of a class in the system, which can help to ensure consistency and avoid conflicts.

* Global point of access: The Singleton pattern provides a single, global point of access to the instance of the class, which can simplify code and make it easier to manage.

* Lazy initialization: The Singleton pattern can be implemented in a way that only creates the instance of the class when it's actually needed, which can help to conserve system resources.

* Thread safety: The Singleton pattern can be implemented in a thread-safe way, which means that multiple threads can access the Singleton instance without causing concurrency issues.

* Can be extended: The Singleton pattern can be extended to support more than one instance of the class if necessary, while still providing the benefits of the Singleton pattern for each instance.

### Cons of Abstract Factory Pattern:

* Global state: Because the Singleton pattern provides a global point of access to the instance of the class, it can introduce global state into your application, which can make it harder to manage and test.

* Tight coupling: The use of the Singleton pattern can create tight coupling between the Singleton class and the rest of the code, which can make it harder to modify and maintain the code over time.

* Inflexibility: The Singleton pattern can be inflexible, since it enforces the creation of only one instance of the class. This can make it difficult to modify the code to support more instances in the future, if necessary.

* Testing: Testing code that relies on the Singleton pattern can be more difficult, since the global state of the Singleton class can make it harder to isolate and test individual components of the code.

* Performance: Depending on how the Singleton pattern is implemented, it can impact performance due to synchronization overhead, lazy initialization, or other factors.

### Should you use it ?

The decision of whether or not to use the Singleton design pattern depends on the specific requirements and context of your application. You should ask yourself if you need to ensure that there is only one instance of a class in your system and if you require a global point of access to that instance. It's important to consider the possible disadvantages of using the Singleton pattern, such as its impact on testing and its introduction of global state into your application. Ultimately, you should evaluate whether the benefits of using the Singleton pattern outweigh the potential drawbacks for your particular use case. If you do choose to use it, be sure to carefully consider how to implement it in a way that minimizes any potential issues and thoroughly test your code to ensure it behaves as expected.
